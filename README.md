# üåå Nebula ‚Äî Real-Time 3D Star Map

**Nebula** is a 3D interactive star map built with Unity, powered by real astronomical data from the Bright Star Catalog. It simulates a real-time view of the night sky using your device‚Äôs orientation and location, aligning the stars and constellations to match your horizon.

This project blends science, design, and immersive tech to create an educational sky exploration experience. üå†

## üß† The Science Behind Nebula

The stars are based on the **Bright Star Catalog** ‚Äî a dataset from the Yale University Astronomical Observatory, containing the brightest 9,110 stars visible to the naked eye from Earth. Each star includes:

- RA (Right Ascension) and Declination
- Apparent Magnitude
- Spectral Type
- Bayer or Flamsteed Designation (when available)

The constellations are drawn using standard IAU (International Astronomical Union) definitions.
